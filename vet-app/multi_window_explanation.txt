This is a straightforward explanation of how multi_window_example.py manages windows using QStackedWidget.

Core Concept:
- QStackedWidget manages multiple "windows" (pages) in a single widget by stacking them and showing only one at a time.
- Switch between pages by setting the current index.

Key QStackedWidget Functions (Managing Windows):
- addWidget(QWidget): Adds a page to the stack, assigning it an index (0 for first, 1 for second, etc.).
- setCurrentIndex(int): Switches the visible page to the specified index (e.g., 1 shows the second added widget).
- currentIndex(): Returns the current visible page's index.
- widget(int): Returns the QWidget at the specified index.
- removeWidget(QWidget): Removes a widget from the stack.

In the Code:
- self.stack = QStackedWidget() creates the stack manager.
- self.stack.addWidget(home) adds HomePage at index 0, Page1 at 1, etc.
- button.clicked.connect(lambda: self.stack.setCurrentIndex(1)) switches to Page1 when clicked.
- back_button.clicked.connect(lambda: self.stack.setCurrentIndex(0)) returns to home.
- self.setCentralWidget(self.stack) makes the stack the main content of the window.

- Imports: Brings in PyQt6 widgets and core modules.

- Classes:
  - HomePage: A QWidget with a welcome label and 3 buttons. Each button connects to a lambda function that changes the stacked widget's current index (1,2,3).
  - Page1, Page2, Page3: Similar QWidget classes, each with a title label and a back button that sets the stack back to index 0.

- VetApp (QMainWindow):
  - Sets window title and size.
  - Creates a QStackedWidget (self.stack).
  - Instantiates Home, Page1, Page2, Page3, passing self.stack to each.
  - Adds each page widget to the stack in order (home as 0, then 1,2,3).
  - Sets self.stack as the central widget of the QMainWindow.
