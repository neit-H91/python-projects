Hi there, little explorer! This is example.py explained simple, like a fun story.

First, we bring in our toys:
- create_engine: A scooter that takes us to the memory box (database).
- Column, Integer, etc.: Bricks to build tables in the memory box.
- declarative_base: The boss builder who makes models.
- sessionmaker: A key to open and use the memory box.
- relationship: Strings to connect toys together.
- joinedload: A helper to bring connected toys along.
- datetime: A clock for times.

Base = declarative_base() is like a big toolbox where we put our building plans (models).

Now, we make the building plans for our animal world:
- Specie: Just a name (like dog or cat).
- Owner: Just a name.
- Medicine: Just a name.
- Animal: Name, and which specie and owner (using strings to connect).
- Appointment: Animal and owner and time when they meet (special key made from all three).
- History: Animal, medicine, and time; connected to animal and medicine.

Then, the engine connects to the file test.db (like finding the memory box under the bed).

We drop all tables (clean up old ones) and build new ones (like setting up new toy shelves).

Session is our key to play with the memories.

Next, if there are no species, we add Dog and Cat.
If no owners, add John Doe and Jane Smith.
Then, add a dog named Rex owned by John.
Then, add a history: Rex got Aspirin medicine today.

Finally, we look at the first history, and bring along the animal and medicine (joinedload, so it's all together).
Then, print a message: "Medicine 'Aspirin' given to 'Rex' on [time]"

That's it! Like writing a story and reading it back.

The memory box remembers pets, owners, doctors' visits, and medicines given. You can use this to store and find info about animals!
